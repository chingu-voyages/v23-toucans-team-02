// // TODO:
// User Story Description
// As an end user
// I want to share my current weather conditions on a social media outlet of my choice
// So I can let my friends & family know what the weather is where I'm at
//
// Steps to Follow (optional)
//
//  Design link to accept parameter for user current weather
//  Post URL to social media - Facebook & Twitter
//  Design API functions to post to Facebook & Twitter
//  Interpret URL parameters when page is displayed to display weather for specific location
// Additional Considerations
//
// tbd


// I'm looking at the share on social media and I believe I will have to use Node.js.
// When the user shares, it will share the city/zip that they entered and pass that
// in the URL that is shared. When it is shared and a new person clicks the link it
// will see the extra info in the url (city/zip) and then fun the weather.js functions
// to pull the weather and populate index.html. While I'm in node, I could
// setup the dotenv as well. Thoughts?
